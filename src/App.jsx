      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Hi, I'm Harsh Malik, a passionate Motion Graphic Designer with a strong love for visual storytelling, animation, and music.
        I specialize in Adobe After Effects and Photoshop, and have worked on freelance projects ranging from rap video edits and lyric visuals to poster designs.
        <br /><br />
        Music is my main inspiration â€” it's the reason I stepped into this creative field. I believe my creativity stands out because I can take any reference and turn it into something fresh, unique, and perfectly reimagined.
        <br /><br />
        I'm always looking for challenging, creative projects that push my skills further and let me bring ideas to life in bold, expressive ways.
